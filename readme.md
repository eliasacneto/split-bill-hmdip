# How much do I owe you? ü§î

We develop this app to use when you're hanging out with friends and at the end everybody has to pay the bill, sometimes you have to calculate some waiter tips. (probably you're drunk and have to stop to do all these calculations).

Then you only have to get your phone, open this app and fill with some information and üí•, you know exactly how much you have to pay.

Awesome, right?! üòé
